## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-14

First tracked release — baseline for version tracking itself, covering
everything shipped so far.

### Added

- Milestone celebration banner on the Dashboard (streak/movie-count
  thresholds) and warmer, less generic empty-state copy across
  Dashboard, Calendar, History, and Activity.
- Redesigned title detail rating control: a single draggable fill gauge
  instead of ten individual stars.
- Film-strip perforation accents on the title detail hero and Dashboard
  header, and heavier icon stroke weight across the sidebar/topbar.
- An Ongoing / Ended / Cancelled status badge on the title detail hero,
  sourced from TMDB.
- Calendar and Dashboard's "Up Next" now actually populate with upcoming
  episodes, season premieres, and movie release dates — a nightly job
  syncs this from TMDB for anything you're watching, have watchlisted,
  or have any watch history for.
- App version, shown in the sidebar footer and on the Settings page.

### Fixed

- Calendar/Up Next were scoped to `WatchProgress.status == WATCHING`,
  a status nothing in the app ever actually sets outside Django admin —
  broadened to also cover plain watch history, so shows synced via
  Trakt/Simkl/CSV import that you're mid-way through are correctly
  included.
